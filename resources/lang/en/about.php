I\'ve always liked to make things on the computer. For example, I already started making a website for my father\'s company early on. This passion has lingered, and when I had to choose a education after my high school, the choice for computing science was made quickly. </ P>

<p> In addition to my study, I like to play games. I also like eating. In addition, I am also a big amusement park fan, which I like to visit with my girlfriend.</p>',
